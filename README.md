# Focusing on internal geography which are prone to floods and Heat waves and outskirts of USA which are prone to blizzards, Sea Level rise through land segmentation 

# Developed as part of AGIS-Agorize Climate Competition in 2023

# Helps improve access to climate risk and intensity data through predictive models and trends analysis

# Target Users: Empowering individuals, businesses, and governments to make meaningful changes that will help mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the planet for future generations

# We are focusing on natural disaster risk mitigation, where we provide an all-in-one informative platform. Our solution has a 3 temporal-prong approach, where we provide disaster intelligence of the past, present and future. Currently, we scope the natural disasters into heatwaves, floods, blizzards and sea level rise.
In the first part of our solution, we present historical data on disasters in an interactive online dashboard. This allows users to easily understand and be aware of the disasters they are prone to.
Secondly, we equip our users with real-time knowledge of what’s happening around them. Leveraging the wisdom of the crowd, we scrape tweets containing keywords associated with natural disasters, as well as an analysis of the sentiments.
Moreover, we provide a sneak peek into the future by forecasting disasters using advanced machine-learning algorithms. Our forecasts can be integrated into users’ planning process, minimizing disaster risks.
